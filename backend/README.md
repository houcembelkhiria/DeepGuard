  <li>What is ELA function?</li>
  <p>
    Error Level Analysis (ELA) is an image forensics technique used to detect potential tampering or alterations in digital images by analyzing discrepancies in their compression levels. it works on the principle that most original JPEG images exhibit a consistent level of compression error across the entire image. When a section of an image is edited, added, or removed from a different source and then re-saved, the tampered area will likely have a different compression history or error level compared to the original, unaltered regions.
